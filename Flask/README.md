The following is the write up from chatgpt. 

In this example, we define two async functions: get_data and update_data. get_data retrieves data from an external API and returns it as a dictionary, while update_data periodically updates the data dictionary with the latest data.

In the Flask app, we define a single route that returns the data dictionary as JSON. We also create an event loop and run the update_data coroutine in the background using loop.create_task. Finally, we start the Flask server using app.run.

Note that asyncio and aiohttp are both external libraries that need to be installed separately using pip.
