# Gym-rat

Gym Rat Is my envisioning of a asmart gym. This README will be used to help you get started on setting up the arduinos, rasperrypi and overall environment to get going.

I am using micropython for the arduino instead of c++. Because of this, the set up for the arduino is slightly more involved in the beginning but I believe the pay off will be worth it. To get set up with your arduino please refer to the following link: https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nano-33-ble/getting-started-omv

As a side note: something that isn't immediately obvious but will save you a lot of time is that once the arduino is in bootup mode, close the arduino IDE and open OpenMV. Otherwise OpenMV won'y be able to access arduino's port.
