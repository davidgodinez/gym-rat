# Gym-rat

Gym Rat Is my envisioning of a a smarter gym. This means in no uncertain terms having things that can be automated left to the computers so that you can focus on what matters, getting in shape and staying in shape. This first run of gym rat refers to a solution to have your workout logs automated for you, i.e having your machines take a note of your reps, sets, and workouts for your gym session. 

This README will be used to help you get started on setting up the arduinos, rasperrypi and overall environment to get going.

Install Gyroscope.ino on your arduino and run Central.py from your raspberry pi after you have created a virtual environment and pip install requirements.txt. 

From there. Stick your arduino atop some weights in the gym and stream to your raspberry pi and azure directly. Enjoy :)

I am currently working on setting up the database end.
