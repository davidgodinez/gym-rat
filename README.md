# Gym-rat

Gym Rat Is my envisioning of a a smarter gym. This means in no uncertain terms having things that can be automated left to the computers so that you can focus on what matters, getting in shape and staying in shape. This first run of gym rat refers to a solution to have your workout logs automated for you, i.e having your machines take a note of your reps, sets, and workouts for your gym session. 

This README will be used to help you get started on setting up the arduinos, rasperrypi and overall environment to get going.

I am using micropython for the arduino instead of c++. Because of this, the set up for the arduino is slightly more involved in the beginning but I believe the pay off will be worth it. To get set up with your arduino please refer to the following link: https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nano-33-ble/getting-started-omv

As a side note: something that isn't immediately obvious but will save you a lot of time is that once the arduino is in bootup mode, close the arduino IDE and open OpenMV. Otherwise OpenMV won'y be able to access arduino's port.
